      "whySwitchBody": "Guerrilla Mail has been running for over a decade and deserves credit for popularizing disposable email. But its interface, ad-heavy layout, and lack of modern features like WebSocket delivery and custom domain support show its age. FreeCustom.Email was built from scratch for modern use.",
      "faqTitle": "Guerrilla Mail Alternative FAQ",
      "faq1q": "Can I import my Guerrilla Mail address?",
      "faq1a": "You can type any prefix you were using on Guerrilla Mail into FreeCustom.Email on a compatible domain. Your messages from Guerrilla Mail won't transfer, but your custom prefix can.",
      "faq2q": "Is FreeCustom.Email as reliable as Guerrilla Mail?",
      "faq2a": "Yes. We run on globally distributed edge infrastructure with 99.9%+ uptime. Delivery is WebSocket-based rather than polling, making it significantly faster.",
      "faq3q": "Do you support sending emails?",
      "faq3a": "Currently, we focus on receiving to prevent abuse, unlike Guerrilla Mail which allows sending (and attracts spammers).",
      "faq4q": "Is it mobile friendly?",
      "faq4a": "Yes, our site is fully responsive. Guerrilla Mail's site is not optimized for modern phones.",
      "faq5q": "Do I need to register?",
      "faq5a": "No, just like Guerrilla Mail, use it instantly.",
      "faq6q": "How long are emails kept?",
      "faq6a": "24 hours (vs Guerrilla's 1 hour).",
      "faq7q": "Can I use a custom domain?",
      "faq7a": "Yes, Pro users can bring their own domain.",
