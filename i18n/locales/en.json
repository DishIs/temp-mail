      "whyUseTitle": "Why Use Disposable Email?",
      "whyUseBody": "The moment you share your primary email, it is often sold to third-party advertisers or leaked in data breaches. Using a disposable address acts as a firewall, allowing you to access content and verify accounts while keeping your real identity completely off the grid.",
